# **Major Project: Raspberry Pi LED Strip Holder**

Hello there! This is my major project submission for Spring Evaluations of CSH 2024

It is a semi-portable Raspberry Pi LED Containment Unit that holds the Raspberry Pi, the LED Strip, and battery power supply to the Pi. 

I learned several things during this project:
1. How to set up, code in, and use a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
2. How to program a LED strip animation using python
3. How to program a PIR motion sensor and link it to a LED strip
4. How to design a 3d model to be 3d printed to be the containment unit for all hardware
